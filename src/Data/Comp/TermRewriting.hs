{-| This function tries to match the given rule against the given term
(resp. context in general) at the root. If successful, the function

substitution. -}

the root of the given term (resp. context in general) by trying each

  evaluates to @(y,True)@ if @f x@ evaluates to @Just y@, and to

  to change the output of functions that apply rules such as 'appTRS'. -}
